## Recent Context (Last 3 Iterations)

<!-- This section is a rolling window - keep only the last 3 entries -->
<!-- Move older entries to archive.md -->

### Setup (manual, pre-loop)
Scaffolded app shell + SQLite schema (closed reader-392/eng-T2, reader-tio/eng-T6
manually, not via loop):
- pyproject.toml: uv project, Python 3.12+, deps=[flask], dev=[pytest,ruff],
  entry point `audibleweb = audibleweb.app:main`
- audibleweb/db.py: migration runner, PRAGMA user_version, applies
  audibleweb/migrations/NNN_*.sql in order, idempotent
- audibleweb/migrations/001_initial.sql: jobs + chunks tables (docs/design.md sec 5;
  chunks table = per-chunk text intermediates per eng D5)
- audibleweb/app.py: create_app() factory runs migrations on startup, /healthz route,
  check_ffmpeg() exits clean if ffmpeg missing from PATH
- tests/test_db.py, tests/test_app.py: 6 tests passing
- All 11 remaining tasks (eng T1,T3-T5,T7 + ceo T1-T6) filed in bd as children of
  epic reader-8f2, each with acceptance criteria already written.

Remaining open issues: `bd ready --parent reader-8f2`

## Project Learnings

Patterns, gotchas, and decisions that affect future work:

### Conventions established by the scaffold
- DB path: `data/audibleweb.db` (gitignored), override via `AUDIBLEWEB_DB_PATH` env var
  — use this for tests via `create_app(db_path=tmp_path / "test.db")`.
- New schema changes = new `audibleweb/migrations/00N_description.sql` file, NOT edits
  to 001_initial.sql. db.migrate() picks up anything with version > current
  PRAGMA user_version.
- Eng D2: vendored TTS-pipeline utilities go in `audibleweb/lib/` (not `core/`) to
  avoid a naming collision with docs/design.md's existing `core/` module names
  (core/pipeline.py, core/job_queue.py etc. per docs/design.md sec 11). Don't create
  a top-level `core/` package for vendored voice/cleaning/chunking code — use `lib/`.
- Eng D13: Flask app stays fully sync. Background work happens in a separate worker
  thread with its own asyncio event loop (reader-z4v/eng-T3). Routes never await —
  they read/write the `jobs`/`chunks` SQLite tables and the worker thread polls them.
- Feedback loop is wired and green: `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .`,
  `uv run ruff format --check .` — keep all three passing before every commit.
